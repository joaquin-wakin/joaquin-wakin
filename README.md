# John Joaquin A. Valdez

A Front-End Developer from the Philippines.

## Education History

- **Academia De San Lorenzo, Dema-ala Inc., Philippines**

  _June 2008 – April 2019_

  During my entire years of studying in this school, I gradually discovered that I could understand
  various information about using software technologies around us.

- **STI College San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan, Philippines**

  _June 17, 2019 – July 30, 2021_

  I took Information and Communications Technology here since I want to be a web developer. Our
  Computer Programming Instructor saw my potential to be a Front-End Developer.

## Work Experience

- **Freelance Front-End Web Developer**

  _October 2020 – May 2021_

  I started from small to medium projects. I have formed a news website before, and I consider that
  as a big one as it has API and reusable components (React.js). I also developed a landing page for
  a company last year.
